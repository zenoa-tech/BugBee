# Project Philosophy

BugBee is an open source issue tracker. The big issue tracker is clunky.
Existing open source alternatives are minimal.

BugBee is also a project to experiment with the .NET stack. BugBee is a sandbox
to explore the latest C# features and general ideas in code organization and architecture.

## Manifesto
1. **The development experience is the most important feature.** The developer
experience directly correlates to the ability of developers to execute on ideas.
The execution and delivery of features and projects has a direct correlation to
the business. Conversely, a poor development experience can cripple the
development team's ability to deliver and compromise business objectives. The
poor developer experience often leaks into the finished product as a poor product.

2. **Optimize for Quality** Quality has two axis. The first axis is quality of
design. Design applies to the conventional meaning such as user-interface
design. Design also refers more broadly to the entirety of the design of the
system which includes the entire development experience from documentation,
building, coding, data-flow, and performance. The second axis is quality of
conformance, which is what most people think of in software; bugs. One of the
key tenets of optimizing for quality is being able to understand the system
and being able to quickly understand when something is out of place. Monitoring
and testing are a part of quality and help us build confidence in the system.
They provide a trailing indicator of quality. Quality must be built into the
system in such a way that when the design isn't working or there are
conformance defects the system doesn't feel right, and correction is natural
and obvious.
