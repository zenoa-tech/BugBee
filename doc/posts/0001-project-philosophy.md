# Project Philosophy

BugBee is an open source issue tracker. I recently setup a project with
template in the big issue tracker, and found that it was clunky and that the
state of the art in open-source alternatives was minimal.

I have some personal goals that I want to acheive with BugBee. Personally, I
enjoy the .NET stack. I feel that it's one of the easiest to get started with
and one of the nicest ecosystems to work in. BugBee is a sandbox for me, and
someday, others to use the latest C# features and also explore ideas in code
organization and architecture.

## Manifesto
1. **The development experience is the most important feature.** The developer
experience directly correlates to the ability of developers to execute on ideas.
The execution and delivery of features and projects has a direct correlation to
the business. Conversely, a poor development experience can cripple the
development team's ability to deliver.

2. **Optimize for Quality** Quality has two axis. The first axis is quality of
design. Design applies to the conventional meaning such as user-interface
design. Design also refers more broadly to the entire of the design of the
system which includes the entire development experience from documentation,
building, coding, data-flow, and performance. The second axis is quality of
conformance, which is most people thing of in software; bugs.
